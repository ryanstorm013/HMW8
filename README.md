## Introduction

Have the user create their own employee generator of their workers by using npm manipulation in node js. Using the prompt will create a list of workers for the user to list their employees.

## How it works 

The user must run.

```node app.js```

Once it's run in the node terminal you will be asked a series of question. It will begin asking about your manager.

This will ask for your manager's:
* Name
* ID
* Email
* Room Number

NOTE: This will only ask once since most workplaces have at least 1 manager.
